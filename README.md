## How to do the thing?

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

   ```sh
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   uv sync
   ```

3. Build binaries (requires `gcc`). This is only required if you want to use the
   `degree_c` reordering method.

   ```sh
   make dll
   ```

4. Build the index. This is a SQlite3 file that lists all the Hamiltonian from
   all the `hdf5` files present in the HamLib website.

   ```sh
   uv run python -m pcb build-index out/index.db
   ```

5. Download the Hamiltonian ZIP files.

   ```sh
   uv run python -m pcb download out/index.db out/ham
   # it is also possible to apply a filter to only download files in a given subdirectory
   uv run python -m pcb download out/index.db out/ham --prefix discreteoptimization/tsp
   ```

6. Run the benchmark.

   ```sh
   uv run python -m pcb benchmark out/index.db out/ham out/results
   #Â or
   uv run python -m pcb benchmark out/index.db out/ham out/results --n-jobs 32 --methods none,saturation --prefix discreteoptimization/tsp
   ```

7. You can obtain temporary consolidated results during the benchmark by running:

   ```sh
   uv run python -m pcb consolidate out/results
   ```

   This is automatically done at the end of the benchmark.

## More help

```sh
uv run python -m pcb --help
```
